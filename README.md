# SampHelper
This is a small python script that will aid samp scripters for taking a quick glance at each function provided by samp.
Im planning to add more features to it.

## Features
* Scrapes function defintions from wiki for quick references
* Get samp based repos. 
  Note: if this program can't find your project make sure you have added "sa-mp" as topics and made a release in your repository.
* Gets samp based snippets (not implemented yet)
